MIKMIDI
=============
MIKMIDI is an easy-to-use Objective-C MIDI library by [Mixed In Key](http://www.mixedinkey.com/). It's a Cocoa-like set of Objective-C classes useful for programmers writing Objective-C OS X or iOS apps that communicate with external MIDI devices, including DJ controllers, keyboards, etc.
